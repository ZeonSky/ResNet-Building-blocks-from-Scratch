# ResNet-Building-blocks-from-Scratch
The ResNet (skip connections) has been the SOTA building block for recent deep learning advances. 
I create this repository to identify building blocks for ResNet and recreate them from scratch.
Rebuilding this wheel is to prepare for future usage of ResNet without reinventing this wheel while maintaining a deep understanding of it.

From my experience doing data science and resonating with the philosophy from the "fast.ai" course, the best course on deep learning that I have completed, I believe in approaching AI subjects from both a top-down and button-up perspective, in that:

 Top-down: You start from the end goal in mind, identify use cases of the subject to establish a sense of purpose during the study.
 Button-up: You develop a firm grasp of each building block to acquire ability to accommodate for future use case variations.

Thus, you avoid shifting focus of the craft of AI to necessary but nonessential demonstration of math prowess; and you avoid remaining superficial and inflexible if you limit your attention only to use cases, utilizing useful but high-level packages that hide away what goes on under the hood.

This repository focuses on the button-up perspective. For more top-down approach, please refer to my other 2 repositories:
