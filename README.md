# ResNet-Building-blocks-from-Scratch
The ResNet (skip connections) has been the SOTA building block for recent deep learning advances. 
I create this repository to identify building blocks for ResNet and recreate them from scratch.
Rebuilding this wheel is to prepare for future usage of ResNet without reinventing this wheel while maintaining a deep understanding of it.

Deeply inspired by "fast.ai" and my past experience doing data science, I believe in approaching AI subjects from both a top-down and button-up perspective, in that:

  Top-down: You start from the end goal in mind, identify use cases of the subject to establish a sense of "why" when doing the study.
  Button-up: You develop a firm grasp of each building block to acquire ability and accomodate for future variation of the use case.
